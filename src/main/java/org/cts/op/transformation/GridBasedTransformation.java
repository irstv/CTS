/*
 * Coordinate Transformations Suite (abridged CTS)  is a library developped to

 * and parameter sets. 
 * Its main focus are simplicity, flexibility, interoperability, in this order.
 *
 * This library has been originally developed by Michaël Michaud under the JGeod
 * name. It has been renamed CTS in 2009 and shared to the community from 
 * the OrbisGIS code repository.

/*
 * Coordinate Transformations Suite (abridged CTS)  is a library developped to 
 * perform Coordinate Transformations using well known geodetic algorithms 
 * and parameter sets. 
 * Its main focus are simplicity, flexibility, interoperability, in this order.
 *
 * This library has been originally developed by Michaël Michaud under the JGeod
 * name. It has been renamed CTS in 2009 and shared to the community from 
 * the Atelier SIG code repository.
 * 
 * Since them, CTS is supported by the Atelier SIG team in collaboration with Michaël 
 * Michaud.
 * The new CTS has been funded  by the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche 
 * (ANR) under contract ANR-08-VILL-0005-01 and the regional council 
 * "Région Pays de La Loire" under the projet SOGVILLE (Système d'Orbservation 
 * Géographique de la Ville).

/**
 * A geographic extent is an area of the Earth surface delimited by a southern
 * latitude, a northern latitude, a western longitude and an eastern longitude.
 * <p> The main difference between planimetric extent and geographic extent is
 * that geographic extent handles the case where the extent includes the 180
 * meridian. In that case, a point included in the extent may have a longitude
 * (ex. -179) which is lesser than western meridian (ex. 170) and lesser than
 * eastern meridian ex. -170).

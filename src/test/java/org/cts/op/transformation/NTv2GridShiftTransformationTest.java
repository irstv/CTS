/*
 * Coordinate Transformations Suite (abridged CTS)  is a library developped to 
 * perform Coordinate Transformations using well known geodetic algorithms 
 * and parameter sets. 
 * Its main focus are simplicity, flexibility, interoperability, in this order.
 *
 * This library has been originally developed by Michaël Michaud under the JGeod
 * name. It has been renamed CTS in 2009 and shared to the community from 
 * the Atelier SIG code repository.
 * 
 * Since them, CTS is supported by the Atelier SIG team in collaboration with Michaël 
 * Michaud.
 * The new CTS has been funded  by the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche 
 * (ANR) under contract ANR-08-VILL-0005-01 and the regional council 
 * "Région Pays de La Loire" under the projet SOGVILLE (Système d'Orbservation 
 * Géographique de la Ville).
